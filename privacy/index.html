                <h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
                <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>
                <h2>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h2>
                <p>Users can visit our site anonymously.</p>
                <p>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.</p>
                <p>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>On our Privacy Policy Page</li>
                </ul>

                </ul>
                <h2>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</h2>
                <p>We don't honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place. We don't honor them because:</p>
                <h2>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h2>
                <p>It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking</p>
                <h2>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>
                <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>
                <p>We market to</p>
                <p>We do not collect information from children under 13</p>
                <p>children under 13.</p>
                <p>Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13?</p>
                <p>No</p>
                <h2>In order to remove your child's information please contact the following personnel:</h2>
                <h2>We adhere to the following COPPA tenants:</h2>

                    <li>Parents can review, delete, manage or refuse with whom their child's information is shared through contacting us directly.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>or contacting us directly.</p>
                <h2>Fair Information Practices</h2>
                <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
                <h2>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</h2>
                <p>We will notify you via email</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Within 7 business days</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We will notify you via phone call</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Within 7 business days</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
                <h2>CAN SPAM Act</h2>
                <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
                <h2>We collect your email address in order to:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions</li>
                    <li>Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.</li>

                <h2>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
                    <li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li>

							Front Team was founded in 2017 by Niv Kaufman and Gilad Laor, whose goal it is to make available and distribute the related communities and tools to every sector possible. We constantly strive for excellence and test where and how we can have the biggest impact. Most of our services are without any financial cost as we believe the importance and effect of the communities in the world of Israeli entrepreneurship is greater than what can be acquired in money. Enjoy the communities, make new friendships, find new collaborations and, most importantly, have lots of success! Niv and Gilad, Front Team.
