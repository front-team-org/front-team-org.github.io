							Front Team was founded in 2017 by Niv Kaufman and Gilad Laor, whose goal it is to make available and distribute the related communities and tools to every sector possible. We constantly strive for excellence and test where and how we can have the biggest impact. Most of our services are without any financial cost as we believe the importance and effect of the communities in the world of Israeli entrepreneurship is greater than what can be acquired in money. Enjoy the communities, make new friendships, find new collaborations and, most importantly, have lots of success! Niv and Gilad, Front Team.
